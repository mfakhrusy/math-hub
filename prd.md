This is a very high level document about the idea of math-hub.


math-hub should solve math problems (ok), real math problem AND problem regarding math problem (so basically help other people do math)
features:

1. polynomial graph visualizer
2. integral visualizer using various methods
3. differential equation solver
4. grid generation (is this math???)
5. matrix manipulation (?) maybe
6. all about geometry (idk LOL)
7. equation solver (?) as in 3x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0
8. check if prime
